MiniPin is a full-stack web application inspired by Pinterest and minimalist design.

## Features & Implementation  

### Boards and Pins

  Users can create boards, and boards can be private or public. Private boards and their pins will not be accessible by other users. Boards can be edited by their users.

  Pins can be created by adding an image through the Cloudinary widget, or added from another board.
